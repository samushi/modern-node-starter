## ðŸ˜Ž Introducing The Project

Express consists of JavaScript, which makes it vulnerable to type definitions.

That's why we avoid supersets with starter packages that introduce TypeScript.

The package is configured to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript.

> The project referred to [express-generator-typescript](https://github.com/seanpmaxwell/express-generator-typescript)

### ðŸ¤” What is Express ?

Express is a fast, open and concise web framework and is a Node.js based project.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Install with the npm Global Package

```bash
$ npm install -g modern-node-starter
```

### Run npx to Install The Package

npx is a tool in the JavaScript package management module, npm.

This is a tool that allows you to run the npm package on a single run without installing the package.

If you do not enter a project name, it defaults to _modern-node-starter_.

```bash
$ npx modern-node-starter "project name"
```
